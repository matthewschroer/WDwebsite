      My name is Matthew Schroer. I am a mechanical engineering
      student at Iowa stateuniversity. I grew up in Lakeville
      Minnesota in a family of five with two younger brothers.
      Being the oldest child of the family I am the first of
      my brothers to do a lot of things. Like driving a car,
      having a job, and going to college. My first year of
      college has been one of the most challenging and fun
      times of my life, Second only to owning my first horse.
      I have noticed that owning a horse and attending college
      have a lot in common. First, the biggest similarity is
      time and money management. Owning a horse takes a lot of
      time and money to keep them healthy and happy, and it is
      the same for me going to college. Second, it takes a lot
      of time, patience, and stubbornness to  achieve all of
      your goals. I have applied these skills to improve my
      college writing and communication skills. Writing is a
      skill that has never come easily to me and I have had to
      work very hard to achieve what I have. My goals for the
      future are to make writing a fun and constructive part
      of my day and maybe write a book about adventure one day.
